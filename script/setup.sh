## Command to build real-time demo (optianal, Windows only, inference only, we provide the pre-built demo)
# ```
# cd thirdparty
# git clone https://github.com/graphdeco-inria/gaussian-splatting --recursive
# cd gaussian-splatting
# cd SIBR_viewers
# cmake -Bbuild .
# ```
# after ```cmake -Bbuild .```, it will automaticly donwload third party libraries provided by Inria (takes several minutes for the first time). </br>
# We need to update two default folders (```CudaRasterizer```, ```projects```) with our provided codes.  
# Just, update everthing except .git in ```extlibs\CudaRasterizer``` with our ```thirdparty\gaussian_splatting\realtimedemolite\extlibs\CudaRasterizer```
# And, update everthing except .git in  ```src\projects``` with our ```thirdparty\gaussian_splatting\realtimedemolite\projects```
# during replaceing, please keep the orginal .git dirtory. only replace the code
# after manually update the two folders, you can rebuild the projects
# ```
# cmake -Bbuild .
# cmake --build build --target install --config RelWithDebInfo
# ```


##### 
# 1. do not remove orignal .git repo in the extlib/cudarasterizor (as the cmake function will use .git to check the exisiting of folder during building, otherwise a new version of original cudarasterizer is downloaded), please just replace the source file only

# 2. if you meet cuda not found error and driver is cuda12 and cuda-toolkit(nvcc 11.8) on windows with visual studio 

# # # remove CUDA 12.xxx in C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\MSBuild\Microsoft\VC\v170\BuildCustomizations  if you see  11.8

# # # building process will select the highest cuda version, so delete CUDA 12.xxx if you want to build with CUDA nvcc 11.8 

#### reactivate conda environment if cuda extension is built ? (not sure)
